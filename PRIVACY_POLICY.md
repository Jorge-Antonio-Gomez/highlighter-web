### 1. What Information the Extension Handles and Why

Quantum Highlighter PRO handles a minimal amount of data, which is essential for its functionality. This data is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted to us.

| Data Type | What It Is | Why It's Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Website Content** | The specific text you select on a webpage to create a highlight or an underline. | This is the core of your annotation. The extension needs to save this text to display it in the sidebar and associate it with your notes. |
| **User-Generated Content** | The notes and comments you write for each of your highlights. These can include rich text formatting (like bold or links). | This allows you to add context and personal insights to your highlights, which is a key feature of the extension. |
| **Web Page URL** | The web address (URL) of the page where you create an annotation. | This is crucial for ensuring your highlights and notes automatically appear on the correct page when you revisit it. |
| **User Activity** | Direct interactions with the extension, such as mouse clicks to select text, menu choices, and keyboard shortcuts. | The extension needs to respond to these actions to function. For example, it detects a `mouseup` event to know when to show the highlighter menu. This activity is not logged or analyzed. |
| **Extension Settings** | Your preferences, such as the sidebar's width, color choices, or whether you've disabled the extension on a specific site. | This allows the extension to personalize your experience and remember your choices across different browsing sessions. |

**What We Explicitly DO NOT Collect:** We do not collect any Personal Identifiable Information (PII) such as your name, email address, IP address, or location. We also do not handle health, financial, or authentication information.

### 2. How and Where Your Data is Stored

All data handled by Quantum Highlighter PRO is stored on your local machine using the **`chrome.storage.sync` API**.

*   **Local and Secure:** This is a standard, secure storage solution provided and managed by your web browser. The extension does not have its own database or servers.
*   **Browser Sync Feature:** If you are logged into your Google Account in your Chrome browser, Google may automatically sync this data across your devices where you have the extension installed. This is a feature of the browser itself, and its privacy is governed by Google's Privacy Policy. We do not control this process.

### 3. Data Retention and Deletion

You have full control over your data.
*   **Annotation Data:** This data is retained as long as you have the extension installed. You can delete individual annotations at any time, which removes them from storage.
*   **Uninstalling:** If you uninstall the extension, your browser will automatically delete all associated data from its storage.

### 4. Third-Party Services

Quantum Highlighter PRO is a self-contained tool. We do not integrate with any third-party services for data processing.

The extension does include optional, user-initiated links for donations (e.g., to PayPal) on its welcome page and within a modal. These are standard hyperlinks. Clicking them navigates you away from the extension to the third-party website in a new tab. This Privacy Policy does not cover the data practices of those external sites. No data from the extension is shared with these sites.

### 5. Children's Privacy

This extension is intended for a general audience and is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.

### 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the extension's functionality or to comply with new legal requirements. We will post the updated policy on this page and revise the "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
